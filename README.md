Exceedingly simple script that processes a text file of review questions in the
following format:

```
What does UNCTAD stand for?
United Nations Committee for Trade and Development

```

And converts into the format demanded for Anki flashcard import, ie:

```
What does UNCTAD stand for?;United Nations Committee for Trade and Development
```

Just something I do sometimes.
